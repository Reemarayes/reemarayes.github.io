    <h2>Game Instructions:</h2>
    
    <p>A Tic-Tac-Toe game can at the most have 9 moves.<br><br>
    The logic for player moves is as follows:<br>
    Each player goes by pressing on an empty space on the board to mark it<br> with an X or an O. The first person to get 3 X’s or O’s in a row, vertically,<br> horizontally or diagonally, wins. </p>
